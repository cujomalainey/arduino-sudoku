Description: 

This program is a colour sudoku puzzle. The user is given a random 9by9 pre-loaded puzzle where 9 colours represent the conventional 9 numbers. The user can navigate the puzzle using the DPAD controller and change the value using increment and decrement buttons. When the user is finished they can check if they are correct with a verify button.
