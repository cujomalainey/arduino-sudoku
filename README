Acknowledgements: 

Calvin Beck provided us with an error catching function that locks the program in the event of an SD card read error. Pay attention to the Serial monitor for this occurrence.

Multiple functions that are being used are provided in class such as:
- quicksort()

Some functions that were provided on eclass:
- x_to_lon()
- y_to_lat()

Description: 
This program displays the map of Edmonton in sections and allows a joystick cursor to scroll between the 16x16 sections. When the joystick is pressed the program displays the closest restaurants based on latitude and longitude and can be scrolled through. Upon repress of the joystick the program reverts to the map scrolling mode.
Scrolling of the restaurants can be utilized with "up" and "down" movements of the joystick.

Code Modification Dependent on Hardware

During the development of the program, a black tab LCD screen was used. If during operation another tab LCD screen is used then the code in the setup() method needs to be appropriately changed:

tft.initR(INITR_BLACKTAB);
example for a red tab LCD: tft.initR(INITR_REDTAB);
